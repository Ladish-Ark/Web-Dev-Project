          <h2>Welcome to my page</h2>

          <p>
            Hi there!!!!!
            Nice to see you on my page. My name is Callum. I am a 19 year old Cyber Security Student. :] 
            <br>I am a huge fan of Movies, Music and Games and therefore this is what I have made this site about.
            <br>My favourite colour is Purple.      
            <br><br>Take a look at each page on this site using the bar above this box to find out more about me and what I like.

          <p>
            I am a huge fan of coding and have been coding for a few years now. I have made a few projects in the past and hoping to make a few more when I can.
            I am just currently focusing on my uni work and getting that done. It also involves me coding so I am still coding and getting the joy from it. I am also learning new things that I am getting taught.
            <br>I hope to start a new project soon and work on it. I am hoping to have it finished by the middle of 2024. 
            <br><br>I also want to involve myself in some other projects that I am interested in and want to help out with. I am planning to become a contributor to some open source projects.
          </p>

        <div class="homepage-columns">
          <h2>Soldering</h2>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/images/index/soldering.jpg" alt="Picture of a soldering iron">
          </div>
          <p>
            I am also a huge fan of soldering and have recently decided to get into the hobby after seeing people do it online. I have found a project that I really wanted to do and make for myself.
            It is a project involving WLED which is making a wifi controlled LED strip. I really want to make one of these for my own pleasure and I think starting with this would be perfect.
            <br>It would let me start with a small project and as I get better and better I can keep improving my skills and working on bigger and better things. Having this equipment also enables me to
            fix things and make whatever I desire.
            <br><br>This little tool is a great thing to have just around for either personal projects or just fixing things around the house.

        <div class="homepage-columns">
          <h2>Flipper Zero</h2>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/images/index/flipper-zero.jpg" alt="Picture of a flipper zero">
          </div>
          <p>
            I am also a huge fan of Flipper Zero as when I saw it first I was amazed by it. It is such a unique device that has been able to compact down multiple cool pieces of tech and implement them all into one.
            <br>It is a device that has a lot of potential and is a great learning tool for people who want to get into the world of pentesting. It is also a great tool for people who are already in the world of pentesting.
            The compact form factor is what makes this device truely unique. It is a device that can be used for so many things and is a great tool to have in your arsenal.
            <br><br>However, that being said this tool is only as capable as the person using it. It is a great tool to have but if you don't know how to use it then it is useless. It is a great tool to learn over time and get better at if u arent already well versed in.
