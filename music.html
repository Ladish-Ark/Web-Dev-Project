        <p>
          Im a huge music listener and listen to a lot of different types of music. I always have music playing whenever I get the chance. I am mostly a fan of Rap and Pop.
          <br>I have tons of playlists on Spotify and I am always adding to them. My playlists can get a bit crazy as I never organise them and just keep adding songs to them. This ends up
          making them <br>contain a lot of different type of music in them.
          <br><br><br>
          Here are my Stats for my Spotify for All Time.
