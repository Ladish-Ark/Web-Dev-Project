                <p> <!-- This is a bit of text about the game -->
                    Star Citizen is a really fun space game. Im in love with space and this game is amazing with great views and gameplay.
                    Its still in development which it will be for a while for how big the game is. I have a lot of fun playing this game with friends and alone.
                    The way there is no loading screens and you can go from planet to planet and ship to ship is crazy. It makes it feel so realistic.

                <h3>Escape From Tarkov</h3>
                <p>
                    Tarkov is a very hard and unforgiving game. Its a very realistic shooter with a lot of different guns and attachments.
                    It is very fun and I have a lot of fun playing it with friends. Its a very hard game to learn and get good at but once you do its very fun.
                    The game is still in development and is getting better and better with every update. I cant wait to see what the game will be like when its fully released.
                    Every moment of the game is unexpected and you never know what you might run into or what might happen.

                <h3>Grand Theft Auto 5</h3>
                <p>
                    GTA 5 is a very fun game. I have played it for years and have had a lot of fun with it. I have played it on console and PC.
                    It is a great game with friends when playing online. The game is very grindy and old though.
                    I cant wait for GTA 6 as im sure it will be amazing considering how this game is and when it came out.

                <h3>Rocket League</h3>
                <p>
                    Rocket League is a football game but except with cars. Its mainly a team game but u are able to do 1v1s if u wish so.
                    However the game mainly is meant for 3v3s which u can do with your own team or random strangers online. This is a really cool game and is very fun.
                    It can require a lot of skill to get good at but once u do you can do some cool tricks. It has a lot of learning to do to get to though.
                    Overall, is a great game to just chill and play with friends or alone but can require a lot of skill depending who the game puts you against and their skill level.
